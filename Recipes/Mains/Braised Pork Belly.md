# Mun Ng Fa Naam 炆五花腩

# Yield
4 servings

# Ingredients
- 1 pound skin-on pork belly
- 1 inch fresh ginger root
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil (for cooking, as needed)
- 1/2 cup Chinese (Shaohsing) rice cooking wine
- 2 tablespoons Chinese dark soy sauce - Kikkoman is a good brand
- 1 cup water
- 1 1/2 inches Chinese brown slab sugar - tastes like molasses
- 1/4 bunch cilantro, for serving (optional)
- Steamed jasmine rice, for serving (recipe attached)

# Steps
1. Cut pork belly into 1-inch by 1/2-inch pieces. Peel and slice ginger root into 1/8- inch slices. Wash cilantro, if using. Set aside.

2. Start a medium-sized pot with a lid on medium-high heat. When hot, add vegetable oil, ginger, and pork. Add on the outside. Stir fry until just the outside of the pork is slightly cooked, about a minute. Then add rice wine, dark soy sauce, water, and sugar to the pot. There should be enough water to just cover the pork. Bring it to a boil then cover the lid and reduce to medium-low heat to cook for 15 minutes.

3. After 15 minutes, stir gently to ensure even cooking and add more water if need be to ensure there's enough water so it does not dry out or stick. Cover the lid and cook for another 15 minutes.

4. At the end of the second 15 minutes, check the doneness of the pork belly. It should be soft enough to easily poke through with a chopstick. If not, cover and cook for another 5 minutes. If ready, cook with the lid off on medium heat to reduce the sauce to a thick gravy. Serve with a bit of cilantro on top. The pork belly is best served hot with steamed jasmine rice.
