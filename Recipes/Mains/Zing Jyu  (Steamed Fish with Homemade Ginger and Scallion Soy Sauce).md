# Yield
4 servings

# Ingredients
- 1 pound fresh trout (whole fish with head and tail, gutted and descaled)
- 3 scallions
- 2 inches fresh ginger root
- 5 cups water

For Ginger and Scallion Soy Sauce:
- 3 tablespoons hot water
- 3 tablespoons light soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder or paste
- 1/4 cups vegetable oil

# Steps
1. Start with a whole fish with head and tail still intact but already gutted. Use a small spoon to scale the fish by running the spoon on its edge from the tail to the head. Do this in the sink to prevent the scales from flying all over. Wash the fish under cold tap water and carefully pat dry both the outside and inside of the fish with a paper towel. Cut three slits on each side of the fish where it is the thickest to ensure even cooking. Place the fish on a large oval-shaped plate that can fit inside a wok with a lid or large Dutch oven.

2. Peel and finely julienne the ginger root, setting aside in a pile. For the scallions, cut 3 inches of the white part from the root up and put them under the fish to evenly distribute the weight of the fish for more even cooking. Finely julienne the rest of the scallion and set aside in a separate pile.

3. To steam the fish, put 5 cups of water in the wok and bring it to a full boil on high heat. Put a steaming rack in the wok and carefully place the plate with the fish on the rack (without touching the water) and cover with the lid to steam on high-heat for 8 minutes.

4. In the meantime, prepare the sauce by mixing the hot water, soy sauce, sugar, and chicken bouillon powder in a small bowl until the sugar is dissolved. Heat 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a small pot on medium-high heat until it is sizzling hot, about 2-3 minutes. (Pro tip: put a wooden chopstick in the oil and wait for it to bubble when it is hot enough.) Turn the heat to medium-low to keep it hot.

5. When the fish is done steaming, open the lid and remove the plate from the wok. Carefully drain any water on the plate. Evenly arrange the ginger and scallion on top of the fish from head to tail. Pour the hot oil over the fish. It will sizzle loudly as the hot oil hits the ginger and scallion. Finish by pouring the sauce on the plate. Serve immediately while hot. Enjoy with care as there could be smaller bones inside the fish. Best served with steamed jasmine rice and a side of stir-fried vegetables.
