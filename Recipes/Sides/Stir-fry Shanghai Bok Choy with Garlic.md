# Syun Jung Bok Choy 蒜蓉白菜

# Yield
4 servings

# Ingredients
- 1 pound Shanghai baby bok choy
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon Chinese (Shaohsing) rice cooking wine
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon granulated sugar

# Steps
1. Cut the bok choy into lengthwise or bite-sized pieces. Soak the bok choy in water to remove any soil. Use a colander to drain most of the water. Roughly chop the cloves of garlic. Set aside.

2. Using a wok or large pan with a lid, turn the heat on high. Once it is hot, add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add garlic, then bok choy immediately so the garlic doesn't burn. This should sizzle and create a lot of steam.

3. Without stirring yet, add rice wine, salt, and sugar. Then quickly stir fry to mix well. Cover, turn heat to medium-high, and cook until the white part of the bok choy is slightly translucent, about 1 to 2 minutes. Cook for longer to achieve a softer, buttery texture, about 3 minutes.

4. When the bok choy is cooked to the desired softness, remove from the wok immediately to prevent it from over-cooking and turning brown.

5. Serve immediately or leave uncovered in the (cold) oven to keep warm until ready to serve.
