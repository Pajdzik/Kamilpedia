# Yield

4 servings

# Ingredients

- 1 cup white jasmine rice
- 1 3/4 cup water

# Steps

1. Use a medium pot with a tight lid. Add 1 cup of rice into the pot and rinse with cold tap water 3 times to get rid of some of the extra starch.
    
2. Add 1 3/4 cup of cold tap water into the pot with the rice. Cover with lid and turn heat on high to quickly bring this up to a full boil, about 5 to 6 minutes.
    
3. As soon as it starts boiling, stir with a spoon or spatula to break up the rice lumps and make sure no rice is stuck to the bottom of the pot. After stirring, cover with lid again to slowly cook the rice undisturbed at the lowest possible heat for 10 minutes.
    
4. After 10 minutes, simply turn the heat off to slowly steam cook the rice for another 10 minutes. Keep the lid covered at all times.
    
5. When time is up, uncover, and fluff rice with a fork or chopsticks. Serve while hot, keeping the rice in the pot with the lid on so it does not cool down or dry out.
