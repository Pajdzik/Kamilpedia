# Yield

About 40 dumpling wrappers

# Ingredients

- 2 cups of all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
- 1 cup warm water + 2 tablespoons, if needed

# Steps

1. In a large mixing bowl add flour and water. Using a fork, start stirring the flour and water mixture until it starts getting crumbly. Start using your hands to knead the dough. Place dough on a smooth surface and keep on kneading until the dough is smooth and springs back when you press your thumb in it, about 10-15 minutes.
    
2. Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.
    
3. Once the dough has rested, divide the dough into 4 pieces. Roll out a long log to about 1/2-inch in diameter. Cut the long into 1-inch pieces using a bench scraper. Make sure to use plastic wrap over dough to keep it from drying out.
    
4. Roll the 1-inch pieces into a ball with your hands. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough to about a 3-inch circle. You may need extra flour to dust in case the dough gets a little sticky. The wrapper should be paper thin. Cover with plastic wrap to keep from drying out.
