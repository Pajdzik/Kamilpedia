## Yield
About 40 dumplings

## Ingredients
- 1 pound ground pork
- 3/4 cup Thai crab paste
- 1 shallot, peeled and chopped
- 2 tablespoon dark soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon mushroom seasoning
- 1 1/2 tablespoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon ginger, peeled and chopped
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
- 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
- 2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
- 4 cups pork jelly (recipe attached)
- Soup dumpling wrappers (recipe attached)
- 1 head napa cabbage, to line steamer basket

## Steps
1. Add all of the ingredients, except for the pork jelly, to a food processor and blend until all ingredients are incorporated.

2. Place pork/crab mixture into a large mixing bowl and add the pork jelly. Mix with your hands. Set in the refrigerator until ready to wrap. Mixture must stay chilled to prevent the jelly from melting.

3. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and dust lightly with flour. Working with 1 dumpling wrapper at a time and keeping the rest covered, spoon a well-rounded tablespoon of the filling onto the center of the round. Using your fingers, pinch and pleat the dough around the filling, leaving a tiny steam vent at the top; transfer to the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dumpling wrappers and filling.

4. Fill a pot with 2 inches of water and bring to a boil. Arrange the dumplings in a bamboo steamer basket, lined with napa cabbage leaves, leaving at least 1 inch between them. Cover and steam over the boiling water until the dough is shiny and the filling is soupy, about 5-7 minutes. Serve right away while you steam the remaining dumplings.
