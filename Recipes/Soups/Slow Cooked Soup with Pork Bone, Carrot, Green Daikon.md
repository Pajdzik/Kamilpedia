# Lo Fo Tong 老火湯

# Yield
4 servings

# Ingredients
- 1 1/2 pounds pork neck bones, split in parts
- 14 cups water, divided
- 1 pound carrots
- 1/2 pound green daikon
- 3 Chinese candied dates
- 2 tablespoons Chinese south almonds (optional) - sweeter
- 1 teaspoon Chinese north almonds (optional) - more bitter
- Kosher salt to taste
- 1/4 cup light soy sauce (for dipping)

# Steps
1. Put raw pork neck bones in a large pot with 6 cups of cold tap water and bring it to a rolling boil. Boil for 2 minutes to clean the bones. Take the bones out and drain the dirty water.

2. Put the bones back into the same pot with 8 cups of cold tap water. Peel and cut the carrot and green daikon into 1-inch chunks. Rinse and drain the dates and two types of almonds (if using). Add everything into the pot with the bones, cover, and turn the heat on high to bring this to a boil.

3. Once it is boiling, crack a small opening of the lid and let this boil until the meat falls off the bones, about 1 hour. Add salt to taste.

4. Serve a small bowl of just the liquid at the beginning of the meal, or with one piece of the carrot and green daikon inside the bowl. Serve the pork bones and vegetables on a separate dish with a side of light soy sauce for dipping.
