# Yield

About 1 quart

# Ingredients

- 4 ounces pork skin
- 4 pounds chicken wings or backs
- 6 slices of ginger
- 6 scallions, cut into 2 inch pieces
- 2 tablespoon shaoxing wine
- 1 tablespoon mushroom seasoning
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 2 teaspoon ground white pepper
- Water, as needed

# Steps

1. In a pot, add the pork skin and chicken backs, cover with cold water. Bring the water up to a boil, cook for around 10 minutes after the water has started boiling, until the pork skin becomes slightly transparent. Transfer the pork skin and chicken backs out of the water and rinse in running water. Remove impurities and scrape the fat layer off the pork skin with a knife or bench scraper. Cut the pork skin into small strips.
    
2. In a high pressure cooker or pot, add enough water to cover the pork skins and chicken backs. Add the ginger, scallion, shaoxing wine, mushroom seasoning, kosher salt, and white pepper. Cook for at least 40 minutes in a high pressure cooker and at least one and half hours for an ordinary pot. Leave the soup to cool down.
    
3. Remove the chicken backs, ginger, and scallions from the broth, leaving the pork skin. Use a food processor or blender to blend the broth for a few seconds. Pour the soup through a mesh strainer. Pour the strained soup into a baking dish and set in the refrigerator overnight to gel.
    
4. When ready to use, cut jelly into small cubes.
    
5. Pork jelly will last up to a week in the refrigerator or can be frozen for a month. If frozen, reheat jelly and pour into a baking dish and set in the refrigerator overnight.
