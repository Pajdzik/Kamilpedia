# Notes
- possible to import with a namespace e.g. `import * as Effect from "effect/Effect"`
	- worse for tree shaking
- it prefers functions over methods
	- better for tree shaking
	- methods are attached to objects or prototypes
- `Effect` type
	- immutable description of an operation
	- lazy
		- when instantiated it does not execute immediately
	- `Effect<Success, Error, Requirements>`
		- Requirements represent dependencies
		- an equivalent of `(r: Context<Requirements>) => Success | Error`
		- frequently abbreviated to `Effect<A, E, R>`
	- not actually a function but a model of computations
	- `Effect` can be executed by the `Effect Runtime System`
		- ideally this happens in a single point e.g. `main`
- Creation
	- Effects don't throw
		- Lack of checked exceptions
		- type system forces to track and handle errors
	- `Effect.succeed` and `Effect.fail` are used to represent the result
	- Constant success effect: `const success = Effect.succeed(42)`
		- `success: Effect<number, never, never>`
			- returns `number`
			- doesn't generate any errors
			- doesn't take any parameters
	- Failure: `Effect.fail`
		- Doesn't limit the type to be of `Error`
		- Recommended to include `_tag` field (Tagged Errors)
	- Synchronous operations
		- `thunk` is a function that takes no arguments and may return a value
			- useful for delaying the computation
		- synchronous operations can be modeled with `Effect.sync` or `Effect.try`
			- it should be certain that `Effect.sync` does not produce an error
			- unexpected errors can be caught with `catchAllDefect`
		- `try` will return an `UnknownException` when an exception happens
			- To provide a more specific error, provide an `catch` function to map the error
	- Asynchronous operations
		- `Promise` in regular JS
			- problematic error handling, no types for errors by default
		- `Effect.promise` and `tryPromise` wrap that for effect
			- similar constructor to `Promise`
			- `promise` does not `reject`
			- similarly to `try`, `tryPromise` is used for promises that reject
				- a `catch` function can be provided to map the errors
		- `Effect.async` is used to wrap callback-style functions
	- `Effect.suspend` delays the creation of an effect
		- takes a thunk
		- useful for 
			- functions with side-effects
			- circular dependencies (recursion)
			- unifying return type
- Running
	- `runSync` executes an effect synchronously
