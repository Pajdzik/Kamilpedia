## Reset proceder
- Download the default Moonlander layout; you'll use it in a later step.
- Unplug your keyboard and disconnect the halves; wait a few seconds before reconnecting the halves.
- Press the upper-left key (= in the default layout) and keep it pressed while you plug the keyboard back in.
- Start Wally and go through the flashing process to re-flash your keyboard with the default layout you downloaded in step #1.
